Procedure

      

Ι, Place at least 8“’><ΙΟ”” gray <or white) cards on the cradle, with suitable bacl<ing to firnaly

 

press the cards against the underside of the platen glass.

2. Set the cameras at the 400 ΡΡΙ position.

iMPORTANT ΝΟΤΕ - an 8“’><ΙΟ” gray card underfills the 5D camera's
7.3'·><io.9·' field of view (FOV) at 400 ΡΡΙ, so be sure to reset the camera's
metering mode as described below to only sarnple the center of the FOV.
The norrnal evaluative rnetering rnode samples nearly the entire FOV. and
the outer portion could improperly alter the exposure determination.
Setting the optimal exposure at 400 ΡΡΙ, rather than 500 ΡΡΙ, is
advantageous for two reasons. First, the effective aperture changes with
focal length. lmages tal<en with the sarne exposure settings at 300 ΡΡΙ will
be about 1ίὸ stop brighter than at 400 ΡΡΙ, while images tal<en at 500 ΡΡΙ
will be about Ιίὸ stop fainter. Βγ setting the exposure for 400 ΡΡΙ, the
differences will be only ἑ Ιίὸ stop from the optimal exposure, rather than
as much as ψ ll3 stop, if the optirnurn exposure were set at 500 ΡΡΙ.
Second, a modest fraction of lenses have been observed to overexpose by
about 1ίὸ stop at 500 ΡΡΙ, while no lens has ever shown any anomalies at
400 ΡΡΙ, making that ΡΡΙ setting more reliable for exposure determinations.

 

 

 

. lnstall a Compact Flash card (any capacity or speed) in the first camera to be set.
Connect cameras via uSss cables to computer with Canon camera utilities installed.

Set the camera shooting mode to aperture priority <Av> (Camera Manual, p. 88) by
rotating the mode dial on top of the camera body.

. Turn on only one of the cameras (applies for all operations).

. When the ΕΟδ Utility comes up on the monitor, select the ''Camera settingsRemote
shooting'' option, which will bring up the ΕΟδ Capture Window (ΕΗ Manual p. 37 [4-2]).

. Set the aperture and lSO speed as specified, per the following table. The shutter speeds are
in parentheses to indicate that those are expected values, to be determined by shooting the

gray card at the specified aperture and lSO settings. ΑΙΙ four settings will produce the same
exposure level. The tradeoffs are that higher lSO produces a slight, measurable increase in
noise‚ which is nonetheless likely to be visually imperceptible except perhaps in highly
contrast-enhanced images. Wider apertures (fs4.o is wider than fl5.0) result in slight
vignetting (darkening toward the edges of the images). not usually perceptible in a nearly-
white page. 'l'he current recommendation is option 3. which has a smaller aperture and
lower ΙδΟ setting than the extrerne values in the table. for less noise and less vignetting.
